How about a "Reverse Reminder App"? This app could specialize in reminding you after you’ve missed tasks. It would simply notify you of everything you forgot to do throughout the day—well after the ideal time to complete them has passed.

Features could include:

Missed Task Alerts: Instead of helpful reminders, it only sends notifications when it's too late, letting you know exactly what you've missed.

"Better Luck Tomorrow" Screen: Each night, it lists all the things you didn’t do, with an encouraging message like “Oh well, there's always tomorrow!”

“Worst Time” Suggestions: Suggests unhelpful, inconvenient times to complete tasks like "Set your alarm for 2:47 AM!" or "Time for lunch at 11:59 PM."

Random Encouragement: Occasionally, it congratulates you on your impressive procrastination skills.
